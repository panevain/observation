## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Opt-in Prometheus metrics (`OBS_METRICS_BIND`), JSON logs (`OBS_LOG_FORMAT=json`) and an `x-request-id` header on every response.
- Release images are signed with cosign (keyless).
- Treemap workflow that refreshes the bundle-size chart for each release tag.
- `cargo-nextest` and `cargo-llvm-cov` support (`mise run coverage`), and a zizmor audit of the workflows.

### Changed

- The CI Docker job reuses the wasm job's `dist/` instead of compiling the client again.
- `rust-toolchain.toml` is the only place that sets the Rust version for mise users; `mise run sync` checks the remaining copies.
